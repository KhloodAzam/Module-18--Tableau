Analysis
Dashboard 1: "Ridership Overview and Growth"

The visualization titled "Total Trips" indicates that Citi Bike members take more trips than non-members. The line graph further shows that while members use the service more frequently, their usage fluctuates over the month of January. In contrast, non-members exhibit a more consistent usage pattern with fewer fluctuations. Notably, the highest number of trips occurred on Day 11, as highlighted in the visualization titled "Growth in Ridership." This is further supported by the stacked bar chart titled "User Type Proportions" within the Ridership Overview and Growth dashboard.

Dashboard 2: "Station Insights and Hourly Patterns"

The dashboard presents the "Top 10 Most Popular Start Stations" and "Top 10 Most Popular End Stations," which largely overlap. However, three stations differ: for example, Broadway & W 58 St is prominent among start stations but not end stations, while University Pl & E 14 St is notable among end stations but not start stations. These visualizations size stations based on the frequency of use. Additionally, the area graphs titled "Peak Hours in Start Time" and "Peak Hours in End Time" reveal similar patterns. Peak times occur at 8 AM (142,305 rides for start time and 136,773 rides for end time) and 5 PM (164,488 rides for start time and 166,121 rides for end time). The lowest activity occurs at 4 AM and 10 PM for both start and end times.
